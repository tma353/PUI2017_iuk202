This is the README file for Homework 6.

For Homework 6, I simply followed along with Matt with his permission. I was also able to get some troubleshooting help from Kent. I tried to make sense of this assignment by going through the code on my own, but there were still some areas where I did not understand why I was getting the outputs I was getting. I am wishing myself luck on this upcoming midterm exam!
