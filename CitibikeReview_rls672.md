**I reviewed iuk202**

**a) Verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly**

From notebook: https://github.com/scheids1/PUI2017_iuk202/blob/master/HW3_iuk202/HW3_2_iuk202.ipynb 
    we want to answer the question: do customers, on average, take bikes for longer rides than subscribers?
    null hypothesis: the average trip duration of 'customers' is the same or shorter than the average trip duration of    'subscribers' with a significance level of alpha = 0.05
    alternative hypothesis: the average trip duration of 'customers' is greater than the average trip duration of 'subscribers' with a significance level of alpha = 0.05

My Comments: The null and alternative hypotheses are well-stated, with clear bounds. The signficance level is stated. 

**b) Verify that the data supports the project: 
i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, 
and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values 
(there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)**


Answer: The data looks well prepared and has the necessary variables and features. The data has been wrangled and means have been extracted for 'subscribers' and 'customers' trip duration. 



**c) chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. 
You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or here, or Statistics in a Nutshell**

Answer: An appropriate statistical test would be a t-test. T-tests look at means (2 means) and look at oberved vs expected results. It can tell you how signficant any difference is.
