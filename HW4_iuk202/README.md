This is the README file for Homework 3, Tasks 1, 2, and 3.

For Task 1, I worked with Davey, Valeria, and Matt (whose code I copied). After doing some reading on the various distribution types, I was able to move towards understanding the code behind it all.

For Tasks 2 and 3, I worked with Davey, Tarek, and Srikanth (whose code I copied). I was quite confused on these two parts, but was able to get through it with Srikanth's help.
