This is the README file for Homework 4, Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For Task 1, I worked by myself and peer reviewed Sean Andrew Chen's (sac820) work.

For Task 2, I worked with Davey and Srikanth. Please see below.

I was not able to even start Task 3.
For Task 4, I worked with Davey, but I was not able to complete it.
