This is the README file for Homework 4, Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For Task 1, I worked by myself and peer reviewed Sean Andrew Chen's (sac820) work.

For Task 2, I worked with Davey and Srikanth. Please see below.

  ## FBB good

For Tasks 3 and 4, I simply copied Srikanth's work with his permission as I did not have a chance to look deeply into these assignments.
